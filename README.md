# PlanMate
This is a project created for module (Project: Java and Web Application Development) for IU International University of Applied Science. 

## Problem Statement:
The modern world is fast-paced and demanding, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of personal, work, and family tasks. People are often juggling multiple calendars, making it hard to see everything in one place. This can lead to missed appointments, confusion, and stress.

Our project aims to solve this problem by creating a comprehensive and user-friendly personal scheduling app. This app will allow users to combine all of their tasks and appointments into one calendar, giving them a clear and organized view of their schedule. With the ability to create, view, delete, and move events, users can easily keep track of their busy lives.

In addition, users will be able to categorize their tasks, set reminders and notifications, and view their calendar in various ways, such as by day, week, month, or year. The app will handle overlapping time slots and conflicting appointments in an intuitive and user-friendly manner, ensuring a seamless and stress-free scheduling experience.

## Features

- Combine tasks, appointments, and events in a single, organized calendar.
- Categorize events to easily distinguish between different types of activities.
- Set reminders and notifications to ensure you never miss an important event.
- View your calendar by day, week, month, or year to match your preferred planning style.
- Handle overlapping time slots and conflicting appointments seamlessly.

## Target User Groups:
The target user group for this personal scheduling app will be individuals and small businesses who require a simple and efficient way to manage their schedules. This includes busy professionals, students, and entrepreneurs who need to keep track of appointments, tasks, and events.

## Benefits of Using the Application:
By using this personal scheduling app, individuals and small businesses will be able to streamline their schedule management and increase their productivity. The app will provide an easy-to-use interface for adding and organizing events, appointments, and tasks, and will also allow users to set reminders and notifications to ensure they never miss a scheduled event. Additionally, the app will be accessible from anywhere, so users can manage their schedules on-the-go.

## Technology Stack:

### Database:
Firebase Firestore (a flexible NoSQL database for storing calendar and user data)
### Authentication:
Firebase Authentication (for secure user authentication and authorization)
### Hosting:
Firebase Hosting (for hosting the front-end of the web application)
